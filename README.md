I'm a self-taught Developer with a broad range of interests which span the software engineering spectrum. I am interested in server-side development, databases, refactoring legacy code, instrumentation, debugging, and security.

In the past I have run Code Clubs which introduces primary school age children to programming. When off line I can found exploring and photographing battlefields of the Second World War.
