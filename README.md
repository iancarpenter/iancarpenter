# Hi I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self taught Freelance Developer and Code Club Volunteer. My interests span the entire spectrum of software development including web development, databases, legacy code, instrumentation, debugging and security. 

Currently teaching myself Angular where I spend most of my time getting over the brick wall learning curve of Observables. I enjoy writing TypeScript and trying to undercover as many features of VSCode as I can. I love attending conferences, listening to Podcasts and reading good technology books. I owe much of my success to discovering the first edition of Code Complete early in my career.

In my spare time I help run a local Code Club which introduces primary school age children to programming. When off line I can found exploring and photographing battlefields of World War II.
