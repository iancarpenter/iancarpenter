# Hi I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self taught Freelance Developer and Code Club Volunteer. My interests span the entire spectrum of software development including web development, databases, legacy code, instrumentation, debugging and security. At the moment I am currently teaching myself Angular and enjoying typescript. I love attending conferences, listening to Podcasts and enjoy reading good technology books. I owe much of my success to discovering the first edition of Code Complete early in my career.

In my spare time I help run a local Code Club which introduces primary school age children to programming. When off line I can found exploring and photographing battlefields of World War II.
